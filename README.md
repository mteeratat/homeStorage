# homeStorage

Develop web application for my home storage(refrigerator) because mine has too much things stored and often forgot leading to expired unused things :(

- Have features such as add data, delete data, search expired and search by keyword

- Using **Python Flask** to build server and some *html* to build interfaces

- Using **MongoDB atlas** to store data

- Deployed on ~Heroku~ **Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run)** https://homestorage-bdavkzxjma-de.a.run.app
